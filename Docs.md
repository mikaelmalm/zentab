Some adjustments we need to implement

- Masonry layout for bookmarkgroups
- Drag and drop between bookmarks
- TimeDisplay area adjustable height
- Bookmark collections
  - might have work/private/fun collections that you want to keep seperated
  - collections should be able to be added, removed and renamed
  - Controlled by a tab switch in the right down corner, if there is only one collection, the tab switch is hidden
